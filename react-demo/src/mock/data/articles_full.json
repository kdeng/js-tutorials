I breathed a sigh of relief - my favourite parks are all there and I can cope with development plans for my area. After four year of work, Auckland Council has done a good job.</p>\n\n<p>However, I remain concerned that Auckland will still be a great place to live. That means retaining heritage areas (tick), views to volcanic cones (tick, but not&nbsp;for Mt Victoria), keeping our parks and buying new ones (mainly tick), managing traffic impacts (big ?) and not building apartments along our beachfronts, among other things. I am opposed to the removal of demolition protection for pre-1940 buildings, because they are part of our heritage. Let's hope there's some more tweaking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Jodi Yeats</strong></p>",
